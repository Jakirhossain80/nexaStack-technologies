 * layout) and `/dev/*` preview routes (outside both route groups) without any path checks.
 *
 * `SpeedInsights` is mounted here for the same reason: Core Web Vitals field data should describe
 * what visitors experience, not the admin's or the dev proof pages'. It does nothing until the site is
 * deployed on Vercel with Speed Insights enabled (it loads `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js`, which
 * only Vercel serves), so locally it reports nothing.
